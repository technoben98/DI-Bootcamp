        <h2>About domestic cats</h2>

        <p>They are often called <em>house cats</em>  when kept as indoor pets or 
            simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids

        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, but there may have been 
                instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years 
                ago (7500 BC). Did you know that, 
                The felids are a rapidly evolving family of mammals that includes:

            Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits 
            grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. 
            It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, 
            but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 
            A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. 
            Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, 
            depending on habitat and prey availability. 
            Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, 
            including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
