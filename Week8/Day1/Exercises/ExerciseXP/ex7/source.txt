Create a directory named file-explorer.

Inside the file-explorer directory, create a file named copy-file.js.

In copy-file.js, use the fs module to read the content from a file named source.txt and then write the same content to a new file named destination.txt.

Create another file named read-directory.js.

In read-directory.js, use the fs module to read the list of files in a specified directory and display their names in the terminal.

Open a terminal in the file-explorer directory.

Run node copy-file.js to copy the content from source.txt to destination.txt.

Run node read-directory.js to list the files in the directory.
