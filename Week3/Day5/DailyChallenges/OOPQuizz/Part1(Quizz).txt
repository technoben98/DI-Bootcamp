Answer the following questions

1. What is a class?

A class is a template with which it is convenient to describe objects of the same type. 
A class contains the properties, creation rules, and behavior of an object.


2. What is an instance?

Object - an instance created based on a template (class).



3. What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation is a mechanism for hiding the implementation details of a class from other objects. 
Achieved by using the public, private and protected access modifiers, which correspond to public, private and protected attributes.



4. What is abstraction?
Abstraction is the main way to deal with complexity in programming. 
It allows you to get away from implementation details and focus on the main thing. 


5. What is inheritance?
Inheritance allows you to isolate behavior common to several classes and put it into a separate entity. 
That is, inheritance is a means of code reuse - using existing code to solve new problems!



6. What is multiple inheritance?
In Python, one class can inherit from several parent classes at once. This is called multiple inheritance.



7. What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is different behavior of the same method in different classes.


8. What is method resolution order or MRO?

Method resolution order allows Python to figure out from which ancestor class a method should be called if it is not found directly in the descendant class. 
If each descendant has only one ancestor, then the problem is trivial. An ascending search occurs throughout the entire hierarchy.
